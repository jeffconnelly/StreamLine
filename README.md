## Link to Deployed Version

https://streamline-capstone.herokuapp.com/

## Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Mocha and Chai
* Mongoose and MongoDB
* Travis CI & Heroku for CICD
* Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery

## REST API

Our REST API is providing data on movie titles and streaming services in an organized manner so users can quickly see which streaming service is available for their chosen title.   
Database: Database can store ~50 static movies on first iteration.  This database schema will include the movie, a few streaming services that it is or isnâ€™t available on, etc. 4 Examples: Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Hulu.

## CRUD Operations

CRUD Operations are based around the idea that users can save their movies they want to store in a Favorites list.  
Create - Click that you want to save the movie, and it will save in your Favorites.  
Read - Generates a list of popular movies on site load. 
Search individual items.  
Update - Can make comments on a Favorited movie, or give it a personal rating.   
Delete - Delete the movie from their Favorites.  

## API to retrieve data from:

API to get data from: We used https://www.themoviedb.org/ to grab data and then model our database based on their information.

## How it can be used
